								<h3>Problem: </h3>
								<p class="description-service">Kashoo Classic and the first rough ideas of 2.0 were developed prior to me coming onboard. Their products were meant to cater to small business owners; however, the product is actually catered towards accountants rather than those who have little to no knowledge of accounting.</p>
								<h3>Solution: </h3>
								<p class="description-service"> To simplify the language to layman’s term so that anyone without any accounting knowledge can understand and use the software. Kashoo 2.0 was built to have a better focus on the users to spend less time on their taxes or expenses and have more time focused running their business.</p>
<!--								<h3>My Role: </h3>-->
<!--								<p class="description-service">Lead designer creating mockups, prototyping and assisting with the front-end development. I also helped with being a QA by testing the app to make sure all the functionality works correctly.</p>-->

								<h3>Kashoo Classic</h3>
								<p class="description-service">While Kashoo Classic is a great product for accountants, the target audience for the Kashoo product shouldn't accountants. The competition with larger companies such as Quickbooks and Freshbooks is too difficult to compete with.</p>
								<p><strong>Issues with Kashoo Classic is as follows:</strong></p>
								<ul class="skill">
									<li>When the user first enters into the software there is no sense of where to start.</li>
									<li>Not sure where to connect a bank account to.</li>
									<li>Too much flexibilities where it could affect someone’s books to be inaccurate.</li>
									<li>Too much show to the user which makes it hard to focus.</li>
									<li>All pages look alike making it confusing to the user making it easy to accidentally input the wrong type of data into the system.</li>

								<h3>Kashoo 2.0</h3>
								<p class="center-text">Prior to my start with Kashoo, an external design agency was hired to take on Kashoo 2.0 visually and experience-wise.</p>
								<div class="center-list">
									<h3>Overall Main Issues:</h3>
									<ul class="skill">
										<li>Just like in Classic, theres too much information for the user to focus on.</li>
										<li>No clear direction of where to start.</li>
										<li>Hamburger menu on the left of the logo isnt that noticeable to minimize the side bar.</li>
										<li>Colours on the Dashboard are too light and hard for those who are impaired to see.</li>
										<li>Action buttons to the side are too faint and confuses users whether they can press it or not.</li>
										<li>The information just below the top header are hard to read and the information isn’t useful to the user.</li>
										<li>Different types of reports in the side menu can be grouped together as Reports instead of listing all.</li>

							<p><strong>Issues with Kashoo Classic is as follows:</strong></p>
							<ul class="skill">
								<li>As the lead designer, I consolidated all the colours in the initial 2.0 look which had over 15+ different shades of blue and narrowed it down to 2 main blues and 2 secondary shades of blue. It is more sharper and bold to the eyes. It’s also easier to differentiate whether an item is editable/non-editable/placeholder.
								</li>
								<li>Adding more whitespace - this helps the user to digest the app more easily. It’s easier to know where to focus and it’s not as cluttered.</li>
								</br>
								<img class="image-covers kashoo-smaller-image" src="img/kashoo/inbox-main.png" alt="kashoo cover"/>
								</br>
								<li>Colours are more accessible to those visually impaired.</li>
								</br>
								<img class="image-covers kashoo-smaller-image" src="img/kashoo/dashboard-main.png" alt="kashoo cover"/>
								</br>
								<li>Easier differentiate each page visually.</li>
								<li>Reduced unnecessary clutter. Ex. Icons in the submenu for Contacts and Accounts.</li>
								</br>
								<img class="image-covers kashoo-smaller-image" src="img/kashoo/contact-compare.png.png" alt="kashoo cover"/>
								</br>

							</ul>
							</br>
							<p><strong>Better Experience:</strong></p>
							<ul class="skill">
								<li> With the integration with Yodlee, if a known Vendor or Client name is in the database of Yodlee, it auto-categorizes the items leaving the user only to confirm to post or, edit if it’s incorrect.
								</li>
								<li>Moving the button to minimize the side menu to a more noticeable place and have it to be more understandable rather than just a hamburger menu.</li>
								<li>Clear direction of what the user needs to do (categorize items then “post” to their books). </li>
							</ul>
