								<h3>Business Problem</h3>
								<p class="description-service">Rosetta Stone’s overall revenue has been declining over the last few years, particularly in their consumer revenue as people don’t see enough value in subscribing. Revenue in the first quarter 2016 totaled $48.0 million, down 18% from $58.4 million in the year-ago period.</p>
								<h3 class="subtitle">Proposed Solution</h3>
								<p class="description-service">An extension to Rosetta Stone’s current app to add value by mergining travel with language learning.</p>
								<p class="description-service">We’ve created this solution for them as their current target market doesn’t see the value in buying into Rosetta Stone’s current subscription model, as many other apps and software such as Duolingo and Buusu, provide a similar learning experience for free. </p>

								<h3>Current Rosetta Stone Application</h3>
								<p class="description-service">In the current application, the main pain point was that it is locked to the horizontal orientation. It is inconvenient to the users when they are on the go to pull their phone out and needing to rotate it every time.</p>
								<p class="description-service">We decided to design the application so that it can be used both horizontal and/or landscape mode. The experience of the application would not be taken away just because of the orientation. Also, the button size and font size would be the same as well.</p>

								<h3>Our Intervention</h3>
								<p class="inner-longtext">Knowing that for many, the best way to be fully immersed is through travelling to a foreign country, and according to statistics, 53% of those who use a language learning software uses it to communicate better when travelling. Currently, Rosetta Stone has no focus, development, or support on their mobile app around the travel experience, and their competitors, such as Duolingo and TripLingo, have a limited reach. To add more value to current RS subscribers, we want to bring RS experience to include in-field experiences so that subscribers can really learn the language while immersing themselves in the foreign country.  Our solution aims to bring Rosetta Stone closer towards the middle of eLearning and travel where none of their competitors currently exist.</p>

								<h3>Journey Framework</h3>
								<p class="inner-longtext">In order to see how to intervene for our target market, we looked at the journey of our persona who is planning to go on a vacation to foreign country. We considered the touch points and pain points and wanted to intervene between the preparing for the trip, during the trip, and post trip.</p>
								<p class="inner-longtext">We found that there were a lot of pain points surrounding Reinforcement. Rosetta Stone has a lot of lessons that prepare users before their trip. However, it is hard to remember and understand what they have learned unless it is applied in context. Reinforcing the material from the lessons during their trip will help them learn better.</p>
