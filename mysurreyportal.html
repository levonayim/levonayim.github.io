								<h3>Solution:</h3>
								<p class="description-service"> A smart and responsive web-application that users can make request from any device conveniently and quickly.</p>
								<h3>My Role:</h3>
								<p class="description-service">Lead designer creating mockups, prototyping and assisting with the front-end development. I also had the opportunity to be a Business Analyst to speak with the client and gather the requirements for the project. I tested the app in different devices and checking if the development meets the requirements and if it functions correctly.</p>

									<p class="inner-longtext">Being part of the UX Team, we were tasked to redesign  one of the services provided by the Planning &amp; Development department for the initial launch of the MySurrey Portal. The Building Records Search is a service provided by the city where anyone can request for information about a single-family home or a multi-family home building that’s listed. The requirements provided by the business was flexible, however the service had to be responsive and everything that is provided on the current application has to be in the redesign one.</p>

								

								<div class="text-title">
								  <h3 class="subtitle">Process:</h3>
								 <p class="inner-longtext">We first approached this project by discussing with the Business to get a sense of the common issues they have heard from the feedback of the customers.</p>

								 <div class="columns inner-longtext text-column">
									<h3>Feedback from previous users:</h3>
									<ul class="skill">
										<li>The service is <div class="inner-emph">not responsive</div>. This makes it difficult and <div class="inner-emph">time consuming</div> for the end users to make these requests while on site.</li>
										<li>The service usually <div class="inner-emph">only worked on Internet Explorer</div>. Some issues occur when using other browsers such as Chrome or Firefox.</li>
										<li><div class="inner-emph">Users don’t notice the option to add multiple address.</div> This results in the user needing to go through the entire process again.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div class="columns inner-longtext text-column">
									<h3>Issues I noticed:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The service is <div class="inner-emph">not responsive</div>. The interface is set to only one screen size.</li>
										<li>While looking up an address, the <div class="inner-emph">street number is not filtered</div> and the user would need to zoom-in then scroll through all the street names.</li>
										<li><div class="inner-emph">Selecting the products is difficult with the checkboxes.</div></li>
										<li><div class="inner-emph">No validation</div> shown to the user till they press the “Next” button to see what they did correctly or missed.</li>
										<li>In the <div class="inner-emph">payment process, it opens up a new window</div> to Moneris’ page.</li>
										<li><div class="inner-emph">Deleting an address was confusing.</div> The user would need to check the address they want to delete but the box is hidden in the top left corner.</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<div class="fsp-final-images">
								  <h3 class="subtitle">Old Design:</h3>
									<div class="columns1">
										<img class="brs-screen" src="img/brs/old-brsscreen.png" alt="fsp"/>

									<div class="columns1">
										<img class="brs-screens" src="img/brs/brs-oldannotied.png" alt="fsp"/>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

								<h3 class="subtitle">Final Design:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>We divided the service into <div class="inner-emph">steps</div> for the user to <div class="inner-emph">concentrate on each main step individually</div> instead of being swamped by a bunch of information at once.</li>
									<li>The main address search the user would be looking up is smart enough to <div class="inner-emph">filter through a database</div> to bring up addresses based on what the user types.</li>
									<li>Each product is a <div class="inner-emph">button</div> so no matter how small the screen is, it’s <div class="inner-emph">easy to select</div> the product they want for the address.</li>
									<li>In the <div class="inner-emph">payment page is iFramed</div> so the user is still in the same screen even though it’s still Moneris that is handling the credit card information and payment.</li>
